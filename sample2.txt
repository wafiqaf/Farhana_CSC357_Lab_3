I'm sure somewhere along the way, I realize (this is...)
Just a child's play (La La La~ sparkling, twinkling)
You showed your smile

I'm the much anticipated Pierrot who never gets discouraged (That's right)
I won't ever hesitate (La La La~ Nonchalantly)
I, too, showed my smile

Every time I strum that melody, my heart calls out to me
This world's frenzy that comes for a moment bursts out

Become a fool and fly away!
It's okay if you only remember a little part of it sometimes
Aren't we just inevitably going around in circles?
You ought to slip and fall in a panic in the final moment

I'm sure that's right, that's how it is
It's okay if you crave those dreams and hopes
I've been waiting for it - there it is!
I rush up towards those 88 stars!
