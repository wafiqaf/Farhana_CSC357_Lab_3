1, 2, 3 the chandelier is falling down
All at once, the neon lights illuminate the room
4, 5 and 6, claps ring out, the spotlights shine at us
Now, welcome to the theater - the show's starting, it's showtime!

Showtime ruler ruler ruler
Take you higher higher higher
Make you crazy, crazy, and even crazier!

More showtime ruler, ruler, ruler
Take you higher, higher, higher
Here's an invitation to be more free and ecstatic
A time that seemed like a dream
